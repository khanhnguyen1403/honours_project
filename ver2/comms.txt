Communication protocol:

- Turning on the device, start a 3s timer (indicate Starting... on the button), send all the settings through
    to the microcontroller (device_properties) (send_settings method)
    + only send data to the microcontroller
    + turns off receiver
- Settings include: power rating, voltage, max current, and protection
    + sends the type of load first (this includes the number of settings)
    + individual settings are sent through
    + if the number of settings received is sufficient, send acknowledgement signal, else settings sent failed.
- Acknowledgement signals from the microcontroller (Settings updated successfully.)
    + change the power button from Starting... to ON

- Start the main receiving loop on the CCN and sending loop on the microcontroller
    + Microcontroller receives acknowledgement signals from the CCN
    + CCN receives instantaneous V and I
    + Transmission package includes device ID
    + 
- Each device has its own ID

- Microcontroller sends V, I through to the CCN, while the CCN sends back a signal indicating healthy transmission

- When turning off, sends a stopping signal to the microcontroller (PWM=0) with acknowledgement.
